    <string name="text_about_cats">All cats express love and tenderness by purring. Listen to the sounds made by your furry pet. They can absorb a wide range of volume, from soft and subtle sound to loud, like the roar of a truck. Thus, cats express a different range of feelings, from delight to anxiety. However, be sure that if your pet starts purring in your presence, it means that he loves you.</string>
